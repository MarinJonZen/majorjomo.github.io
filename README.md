# majorjomo.github.io

Personal development scratch pad.  This site will contain the following:
* Technical journal of ideas
* Document the various systems that I have defined for myself over the years
* Architectural ideas and assessments
* Last but not least, code tons of code.  I've been working primarily in the closed-source would so haven't put much up here yet.
